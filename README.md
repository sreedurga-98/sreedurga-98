Hai i'am Sreedurga.

I am a Data Science student with strong foundational knowledge in Python, NumPy, Pandas, Statistics, SQL, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). I have worked on multiple real-world and academic projects that demonstrate my ability to clean data, analyze patterns, build predictive models, and extract meaningful insights.

My projects include;

- HR Employee Attrition Prediction (Machine Learning Classification)

- Netflix Data Analysis (EDA & Visualization)

- 911 Calls Data Analysis (Trend & Pattern Analysis)

- Face Mask Detection (Deep Learning & Computer Vision)

- Tic Tac Toe Game (Python Console Project)

- Hand Cricket Game (Python Logic-Based Project)

Through these projects, I have gained hands-on experience in data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, evaluation metrics, and visualization techniques.

Currently, I am expanding my knowledge in Artificial Intelligence, Excel, Tableau, and Power BI to strengthen my analytical and business intelligence skills.

I am passionate about continuous learning and focused on growing as an AI and Machine Learning professional.
